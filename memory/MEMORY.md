# Long-term Memory
*Last consolidated: 2026-03-10*

## About This Repo
- Autonomous agent running on GitHub Actions via Claude Code
- Telegram delivery configured via TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
- X.AI Grok API available via XAI_API_KEY for searching Twitter/X

## Active Goals
- Continue daily digests (all channels operational as of 2026-03-10)
- Address code health findings — see [topics/code-health.md](topics/code-health.md)
- Configure DeFi/on-chain monitors (currently empty watchlists)

## Features Built
- **reddit-digest** (2026-03-10) — Fetches and summarizes top Reddit posts from tracked subreddits. Config: `memory/subreddits.yml`. No auth required (uses public JSON API).
- **security-digest** (2026-03-10) — Monitors recent critical/high-severity security advisories from GitHub Advisory Database. Filters by ecosystem (npm, pip, Go, crates.io, etc.) and CVSS score. No auth required.

## Lessons Learned
- Digest format: Markdown with clickable links, under 4000 chars
- Always save files AND commit before logging
- `notify.sh` requires manual approval in CI environment (not auto-allowed)
- Code health: no tests exist, monolithic workflow (426 lines), dead `pr-body.txt` — see [topics/code-health.md](topics/code-health.md)

## Tracked Tokens
| CoinGecko ID | Symbol | Alert Threshold (24h %) | Price Threshold |
|--------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------|
| bitcoin | BTC | 10% | — |
| ethereum | ETH | 10% | — |
| solana | SOL | 10% | — |

## Next Priorities
- Send first digest *(stalled since 2026-03-10 — skill built but not yet executed)*
- Continue daily digests
- Address code health findings: remove dead files, add tests, split workflow
- Reddit JSON API blocked from GitHub Actions IPs; use indirect web search as fallback
- Consider alternative Reddit data sources (API blocked from GH Actions)
- `./notify` requires manual approval in CI (not auto-allowed)
- Reddit JSON API and WebSearch both blocked from GH Actions IPs; use indirect web search fallback
- See [topics/code-health.md](topics/code-health.md) for technical debt notes
- Continue daily digests (reddit-digest first run complete 2026-03-10)
- Consolidate notification volume — bundle digests into fewer messages
- Configure or disable idle monitors (DeFi, On-Chain) to save Actions minutes
- Address code health findings: remove `pr-body.txt`, add cron parser tests, split workflow
- Formalize web search as primary Reddit data source (JSON API blocked from GH Actions)
